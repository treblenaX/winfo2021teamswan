# Project Agora
Agora is a social media platform for developers and organizations to share projects and ideas, encouraging a more collaborative environment in the technology space.
Oftentimes, coders start out in isolation, as institutions often do not teach the skills needed to evaluate diverse perspectives or work as part of a team. Agora aims to change how programming is approached by connecting skilled technologists with projects and teams that need their help. In providing a place where teams can share their ideas with the world, Agora aims to unite people around a vision of a better, more technologically advanced world.
Programming is not often viewed as a social activity, but that’s far from reality -- teamwork is actually a key aspect of being a successful developer. We aim to encourage a more collaborative environment in the technology space by creating Agora, a social media platform for developers and organizations to share projects and ideas. 
With Agora, developers can easily access innovations from around the world, and collaborate by requesting helpers or contributing their own skills to others’ works. Non-profits can also use this space to recruit volunteers to their cause. 
Developers lack a dedicated space where they can share their projects to an equally excited audience, and view many other independent works from around the world. That’s where Agora comes in.
